        summary="Implied default locale in case conversion"
        explanation="Calling `String#toLowerCase()` or `#toUpperCase()` **without specifying an explicit locale** is a common source of bugs. The reason for that is that those methods will use the current locale on the user&apos;s device, and even though the code appears to work correctly when you are developing the app, it will fail in some locales. For example, in the Turkish locale, the uppercase replacement for `i` is **not** `I`.&#xA;&#xA;If you want the methods to just perform ASCII replacement, for example to convert an enum name, call `String#toUpperCase(Locale.US)` instead. If you really want to use the current locale, call `String#toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault())` instead."

        summary="Implied locale in date format"
        explanation="Almost all callers should use `getDateInstance()`, `getDateTimeInstance()`, or `getTimeInstance()` to get a ready-made instance of SimpleDateFormat suitable for the user&apos;s locale. The main reason you&apos;d create an instance this class directly is because you need to format/parse a specific machine-readable format, in which case you almost certainly want to explicitly ask for US to ensure that you get ASCII digits (rather than, say, Arabic digits).&#xA;&#xA;Therefore, you should either use the form of the SimpleDateFormat constructor where you pass in an explicit locale, such as Locale.US, or use one of the get instance methods, or suppress this error if really know what you are doing."

        explanation="When setting text sizes, you should normally use `sp`, or &quot;scale-independent pixels&quot;. This is like the `dp` unit, but it is also scaled by the user&apos;s font size preference. It is recommend you use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for both the screen density and the user&apos;s preference.&#xA;&#xA;There **are** cases where you might need to use `dp`; typically this happens when the text is in a container with a specific dp-size.

        severity="Warning"
        message="On SDK version 23 and up, your app data will be automatically backed up and restored on app install.

        category="Security"

        summary="AllowBackup/FullBackupContent Problems"
        explanation="The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup&#xA;&#xA;By default, this flag is set to `true` which means application data can be backed up and restored by the OS. Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts the application out of being backed up and so users can&apos;t restore data related to it when they go through the device setup wizard.&#xA;&#xA;Allowing backups may have security consequences for an application. Currently `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.&#xA;&#xA;If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` to configure auto backup."
